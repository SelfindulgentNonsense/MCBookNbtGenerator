# MCBookNbtGenerator
Creates Loottable for a written book. Automatic page + line wrapping.
Program will take in normally formatted text, author and title and return the signed book loottable. Page wrapping automatic.
Program will completely break down if there isnt a space every now and then. In general, this hasn't been tested on all that many edge cases.
Your IDE will probably mark the new lines etc weirdly but trust me it works.
Not currently designed to handle [ ] { } \ ' " and anything in that department (If you want to do dialogue, use â€™ instead.). working on that, for now, please just use text. the program will remove those characters though.

### How to use
To use, just download both of the files, extract them, then make sure they are in the same folder while you open the "index.html" file in a browser.
